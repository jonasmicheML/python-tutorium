    "4. **Branching:** You can work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.\n",

    "### Basic Git Commands\n",
    "All the commands below are executed in the command line. You have to navigate to your project's directory first. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initializing a Git Repository:**\n",
    "   - To start version controlling a project, navigate to your project's directory and run the following command or do it via [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/):\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git init\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Checking the Status:**\n",
    "   - To see which files have been modified and are ready to be committed, use:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git status\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adding Files to the Staging Area:**\n",
    "   - Before commiting changes, you need to add the files to the staging area. This step is important because it allows you to selectively include changes in the next commit. When you \"add\" a file, you are telling Git to include the changes in that file in the next commit. This allows you to group related changes together in a commit.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git add <file>       # add a specific file\n",
    "   git add .            # add all files in qurrent directory \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Commiting Changes:**\n",
    "   - Once files are in the staging area, you can commit your changes with a descriptive message. A commit is a snapshot of the changes you've made. It records the state of your project at a specific point in time. The key difference between \"adding\" and \"committing\" is that adding stages the changes you want to include in the next commit, while committing records these changes in your project's history. Commits are like checkpoints in your project's timeline, making it easier to track and manage changes over time.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git commit -m \"Your commit message\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Viewing the Commit History:**\n",
    "   - To see a list of all commits, use:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git log\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Creating a Branch:**\n",
    "   - To work on a new feature or bug fix without affecting the main code, create a new branch:\n",
    "      \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git branch <branch-name>\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Switching Branches:**\n",
    "   - To switch to a different branch, use:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git checkout <branch-name>\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Merging Branches:**\n",
    "   - When you're done with your new feature, you can merge it back into the main code:\n",
    "      \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git merge <branch-name>\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Pulling and Pushing:**\n",
    "   - When working with remote repositories (like on GitHub or GitLab), you can pull changes from a remote repository:\n",
    "         \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git pull\n",
    "   ```\t\n",
    "\n",
    "   - To push your local changes to a remote repository, use:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git push\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Reverting Changes:**\n",
    "      - To revert a commit, use the following command. This is a safer method to undo changes, as it creates a new commit that reverts the changes of the specified commit (If you want to completely remove a commit from the history, you can use `git reset <commit-hash>` instead):\n",
    "      \n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      git revert <commit-hash>\n",
    "      ```\t\n",
    "\n",
    "      - This is a safe method to undo changes, as it creates a new commit that reverts the changes of the specified commit. If you want to completely remove a commit from the history, use:\n",
    "      \n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      git reset <commit-hash>\n",
    "      ```\t\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Cloning a Repository:**\n",
    "      - To clone a remote repository to your local machine, use:\n",
    "      \n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      git clone <url>"
